# Alcobra
Alcobra is a collection of machine learning tools written in C. For those interested, the goal of this project is to use matrix-based implementations to simplify the translation of mathematic machine learning concepts into practical code. For those who want a minimalist, simple, and fast library they can use the Alcobra API in their own machine learning projects.
